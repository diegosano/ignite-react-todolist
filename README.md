  :heavy_check_mark: To-do List
</h1> 

<p align="center">
  This project's main objective is to build a small application of a to-do list and training a little more about state manipulation in React.
</p>

## :sparkles: Features

* Add a new task: It must be possible to add a new task in the task state with the fields id which must be generated randomly, a title which must be text and isComplete which must start as false.
* Remove a task: You must receive an ID by parameter and remove the task that contains that ID from the state.
* Mark and unmark a task as completed: You must change the status of isComplete for a task with a specific ID that is received by parameter.
